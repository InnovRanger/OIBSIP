C is a general-purpose computer programming language for system administration, network programming, and embedded software.C++ is used in fields such as system software, game development, embedded systems, scientific computing and high-performance applications. Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself. Programming skills, or coding skills, are the skills we use to write instructions for computers, applications, or software. They include different programming languages and concepts. What skills do I need to code? To start, you'll need knowledge of at least one programming language.

                I have always had a passion for helping others; this trait stems from the example my parents have set for me. I was exposed to consistent love and kindness, a respect my parents displayed to not only me, but strangers as well. I’ve experienced both poverty and wealth. I was raised in poverty, sharing a two-bedroom apartment with my family of six members. I watched my parents struggle as they attempted to create a comfortable life for my brothers and I. Their devotion to God, alongside their generosity and hard work, is what allowed me to experience life of wealth as well. My family now runs multiple home health businesses, which I would otherwise inherit. However, I have decided to take a different direction as this is not where my passion lies. I chose nursing with the similar intent that AUHS states; providing competent, caring, and evidence-based nursing services to diverse patient populations. I wish to build and develop my caring skills into something with academic backing so I know that as well as being well; meaning, my interventions can be medically effective.

                    India, country that occupies the greater part of South Asia. It is made up of 28 states and eight union territories, and its national capital is New Delhi, built in the 20th century just south of the historic hub of Old Delhi to serve as India’s administrative center. India remains one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world. Apart from its many religions and sects, India is home to innumerable castes and tribes, as well as to more than a dozen major and hundreds of minor linguistic groups from several language families unrelated to one another.
